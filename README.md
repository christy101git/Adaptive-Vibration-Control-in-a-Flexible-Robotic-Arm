# Adaptive-Vibration-Control-in-a-Flexible-Robotic-Arm
Adaptive Vibration Control in a Flexible Robotic Arm â€” A simulation-based project that models and suppresses vibrations in flexible robotic arms using PDEs, Laplace transforms, and optimization. Implements state-space modeling, PD control, and real-time vibration analysis in Python.
